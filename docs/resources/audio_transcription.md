# openai_audio_transcription (Resource)

Creates an audio transcription. Note: This resource does not support updates - any configuration change will create a new resource.



<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `file` (String) Path to the audio file to transcribe (format: flac, mp3, mp4, mpeg, mpga, m4a, ogg, wav, or webm)
- `model` (String) ID of the model to use (e.g., 'whisper-1', 'gpt-4o-transcribe', 'gpt-4o-mini-transcribe')

### Optional

- `include` (List of String) Additional information to include in the transcription response. 'logprobs' will return the log probabilities of the tokens in the response. Only works with response_format set to 'json' and only with gpt-4o models.
- `language` (String) The language of the input audio (ISO-639-1 format)
- `prompt` (String) An optional text to guide the model's style or continue a previous audio segment
- `response_format` (String) The format of the transcript output. Note: For gpt-4o-transcribe and gpt-4o-mini-transcribe, only 'json' is supported.
- `stream` (Boolean) If set to true, the model response data will be streamed to the client as it is generated. Not supported for whisper-1 model.
- `temperature` (Number) The sampling temperature, between 0 and 1
- `timestamp_granularities` (List of String) The timestamp granularities to populate for this transcription. response_format must be set to verbose_json to use timestamp granularities. Either or both of these options are supported: 'word', or 'segment'.

### Read-Only

- `duration` (Number) The duration of the audio in seconds
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `segments` (List of Object) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--segments))
- `text` (String) The transcribed text

<a id="nestedatt--segments"></a>
### Nested Schema for `segments`

Read-Only:

- `avg_logprob` (Number)
- `compression_ratio` (Number)
- `end` (Number)
- `id` (Number)
- `no_speech_prob` (Number)
- `seek` (Number)
- `start` (Number)
- `temperature` (Number)
- `text` (String)
- `tokens` (List of Number)
