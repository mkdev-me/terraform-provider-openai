# openai_speech_to_text (Resource)

Creates a speech-to-text transcription. Note: This resource does not support updates - any configuration change will create a new resource.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Example: Converting speech to text using OpenAI's Whisper model
# The Speech-to-Text API transcribes audio into text in the original language

# Basic transcription
resource "openai_speech_to_text" "podcast_transcript" {
  # The audio file to transcribe
  file = "speech.mp3"

  # Model to use - currently only "whisper-1" is available
  model = "whisper-1"

  # Optional: Language of the audio (ISO-639-1 format)
  # If not specified, Whisper will auto-detect
  language = "en"

  # Optional: Response format (json, text, srt, verbose_json, or vtt)
  # Default is "json"
  response_format = "text"

  # Optional: Temperature for sampling (0 to 1)
  # Lower values are more deterministic
  temperature = 0.0
}

# Transcription with timestamps (SRT format for subtitles)
resource "openai_speech_to_text" "podcast_subtitles" {
  file  = "speech.mp3"
  model = "whisper-1"

  # SRT format includes timestamps
  response_format = "srt"

  # Provide context to improve accuracy
  prompt = "This is a tech podcast discussing AI and machine learning trends."
}

# Verbose transcription with word-level timestamps
resource "openai_speech_to_text" "detailed_transcript" {
  file  = "speech.mp3"
  model = "whisper-1"

  # Verbose JSON includes word-level timestamps and confidence scores
  response_format = "verbose_json"

  # Help the model with proper nouns and technical terms
  prompt = "Meeting participants: John Smith, Sarah Johnson. Topics: Q4 revenue, Project Alpha, TensorFlow implementation."

  # Auto-detect language
  # language = null
}

# Transcription for multi-language content
resource "openai_speech_to_text" "spanish_transcript" {
  file     = "speech.mp3"
  model    = "whisper-1"
  language = "es" # Spanish

  # Get clean text output
  response_format = "text"

  # Context in the target language
  prompt = "Entrevista sobre tecnología e innovación en América Latina."
}

# WebVTT format for web video players
resource "openai_speech_to_text" "video_captions" {
  file  = "speech.mp3"
  model = "whisper-1"

  # VTT format for HTML5 video
  response_format = "vtt"

  temperature = 0.2 # Slightly higher for natural flow
}

# Output the transcription text
output "podcast_text" {
  value = openai_speech_to_text.podcast_transcript.text
}

## Schema

### Required

- `file` (String) The path to the audio file to transcribe. Supported formats: flac, mp3, mp4, mpeg, mpga, m4a, ogg, wav, or webm.
- `model` (String) The model to use for speech-to-text transcription. Options include 'whisper-1', 'gpt-4o-transcribe', and 'gpt-4o-mini-transcribe'.

### Optional

- `include` (List of String) Additional information to include in the transcription response. 'logprobs' will return the log probabilities of the tokens in the response to understand the model's confidence in the transcription. Only works with response_format set to 'json' and only with gpt-4o models.
- `language` (String) The language of the input audio. Supplying the input language in ISO-639-1 format will improve accuracy and latency.
- `prompt` (String) An optional text to guide the model's style or continue a previous audio segment.
- `response_format` (String) The format of the transcript output. Options include 'json', 'text', 'srt', 'verbose_json', or 'vtt'. Note: For gpt-4o-transcribe and gpt-4o-mini-transcribe, only 'json' is supported.
- `stream` (Boolean) If set to true, the model response data will be streamed to the client as it is generated. Not supported for whisper-1 model.
- `temperature` (Number) The sampling temperature, between 0 and 1. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic.
- `timestamp_granularities` (List of String) The timestamp granularities to populate for this transcription. response_format must be set to verbose_json to use timestamp granularities. Either or both of these options are supported: 'word', or 'segment'.

### Read-Only

- `created_at` (Number) The timestamp when the transcription was generated.
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `text` (String) The transcribed text.
