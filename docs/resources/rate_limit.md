# openai_rate_limit (Resource)

Manages rate limits for an OpenAI model in a project. Note that rate limits cannot be truly deleted via the API, so this resource will reset rate limits to defaults when removed. This resource requires an admin API key with the api.management.read scope for full functionality, but will gracefully handle permission errors to allow operations to continue.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Set rate limits for GPT-4o model in a project
resource "openai_rate_limit" "gpt4o_limits" {
  project_id = "proj_abc123"
  model      = "gpt-4o"

  max_requests_per_minute = 500
  max_tokens_per_minute   = 30000
}

# Set rate limits for GPT-4o-mini with additional constraints
resource "openai_rate_limit" "gpt4o_mini_limits" {
  project_id = "proj_abc123"
  model      = "gpt-4o-mini"

  max_requests_per_minute = 1000
  max_tokens_per_minute   = 60000
  max_requests_per_1_day  = 10000
}

# Set rate limits for DALL-E 3 image generation
resource "openai_rate_limit" "dalle3_limits" {
  project_id = "proj_abc123"
  model      = "dall-e-3"

  max_images_per_minute = 5
}

# Set rate limits for batch processing
resource "openai_rate_limit" "batch_limits" {
  project_id = "proj_abc123"
  model      = "gpt-4o"

  batch_1_day_max_input_tokens = 1000000
}
```
