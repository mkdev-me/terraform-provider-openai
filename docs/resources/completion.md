# openai_completion (Resource)





<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `model` (String) ID of the model to use for completion
- `prompt` (String) The prompt to generate completions for

### Optional

- `best_of` (Number) Generates best_of completions server-side and returns the 'best'
- `echo` (Boolean) Echo back the prompt in addition to the completion
- `frequency_penalty` (Number) Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their existing frequency in the text so far
- `logit_bias` (Map of Number) Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion
- `logprobs` (Number) Include the log probabilities on the logprobs most likely tokens, between 0 and 5
- `max_tokens` (Number) The maximum number of tokens to generate in the completion
- `n` (Number) How many completions to generate for each prompt
- `presence_penalty` (Number) Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far
- `project_id` (String) The project to use for this request
- `stop` (List of String) Up to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens
- `stream` (Boolean) Whether to stream back partial progress
- `suffix` (String) The suffix that comes after a completion of inserted text
- `temperature` (Number) Sampling temperature between 0 and 2. Higher values make output more random, lower values make it more deterministic
- `top_p` (Number) Nuclear sampling: consider the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. Range from 0 to 1
- `user` (String) A unique identifier representing your end-user

### Read-Only

- `choices` (List of Object) The list of completion choices the model generated for the input prompt (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--choices))
- `completion_id` (String) The ID of the completion
- `created` (Number) The Unix timestamp (in seconds) of when the completion was created
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `model_used` (String) The model used for the completion
- `object` (String) The object type, which is always 'text_completion'
- `usage` (Map of Number) Usage statistics for the completion request

### Nested Schema for `choices.logprobs`

Read-Only:
