### Optional

- `existing_thread_id` (String) The ID of an existing thread to use for this run.
- `instructions` (String) Instructions that override the assistant's instructions for this run only.
- `max_completion_tokens` (Number) The maximum number of tokens that can be generated in the run completion.
- `metadata` (Map of String) Set of key-value pairs that can be attached to the run.
- `model` (String) The ID of the model to use for the run. If not provided, the assistant's default model will be used.

- `thread` (Block List, Max: 1) Configuration for creating a new thread for this run. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--thread))
- `tools` (Block List) Override the tools the assistant can use for this run. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--tools))
