This is a sample text file for testing OpenAI vector store file creation.

It contains basic information about Terraform testing with the OpenAI provider.
Testing the retry logic for eventual consistency issues when creating vector store files.

Key points:
- Vector stores are used for assistants and file search
- Files need to be uploaded first before adding to vector store
- The OpenAI API may experience eventual consistency delays
- This test validates the retry logic handles these delays correctly

End of test file.
