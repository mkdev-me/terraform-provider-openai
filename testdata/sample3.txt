Sample file 3 for testing multiple vector store file creation.

This is the third and final file in the concurrent upload test batch.
It validates that the exponential backoff retry logic works correctly
when multiple API calls are made simultaneously.

Expected behavior:
- All three files should be successfully added to the vector store
- Any temporary "file not found" errors should be retried automatically
- Maximum of 5 retry attempts with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s)
